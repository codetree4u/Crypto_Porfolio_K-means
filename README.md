# Crypto_Porfolio_K-means

This is a Jupyter Notebook that uses Pandas hvplot and scikit-learn in a Conda enviroment.  In this exercise, we combine Python programming skills with unsupervised learning techniques to cluster a crypto porfolio based on performance in differnt time periods.  The data then gets plot to illustrate the insights, Explore, discover and have fun using this notebook.
